Welcome to **JRG Tools** — a one-human studio on a mission to build bold, clever digital tools with soul. I’m Jorge (or **Khoa** in 🇻🇳), a solopreneur born in Spain and bred in the Internet. I partner only when the project **sparks genuine excitement**.

This isn’t a startup. It’s not an agency. It’s just me, a laptop, and a lot of vim (and Neovim). 💻

Since launching, I've pushed code from Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and across coffee shops, coworking desks, and sleeper trains — all in pursuit of building tools that **feel right** and **work hard**. Whether it’s internal platforms, creative bots, or powerful dashboards, if it’s fun and useful, I’m shipping it.

### 🌍 Built for the web, fueled by love

Here’s a quick look at what makes JRG Tools tick:

- 🔧 Always shipping small tools with big impact  
- 💬 Collaborating with humans, not corporations  
- 🚀 Everything runs on modern stacks, and most are serverless by default  
- 🧪 MVP-first philosophy: build → test → iterate  

I maintain public-facing projects like:

- Coming soon: [A travel assistant](https://exploreasia.ai/), and more!

    <li>Tooling is as important as the idea — that’s why I obsess over DX, test coverage, and clear docs.</li>
    <li>Oh, and I love 🦾 automating the boring stuff.</li>
